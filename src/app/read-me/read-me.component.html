    <h1>Welcome to your new Angular App! üéâ</h1>
  </header>
  <header>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  </header>
  <p>
    The guts of this app live in the <code>~/src/app/</code> directory. You should see several items in that
    folder. Right now, you're reading the contents of <code>read-me/read-me.component.html</code>, which itself
    lives inside <code>home/home.component.html</code>. If you'd like to get developing right away, go ahead and
    remove the <code>app-read-me</code> element from the home component. Then, create a new component with the
    following command: <code [innerHTML]="generateCommand"></code>. Don't forget to delete the read-me component when
    you're done!
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're new to VSCode, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">try it out if you haven't</a>, and check
    out the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chris-bell.experity-vscode-extension-pack"
      target="_blank">Experity VSCode Extension Pack</a>. In it you'll find numerous functional and cosmetic upgrades
    to VSCode, including Angular development tools, a code spell-checker, GitLens, Live Code Share and more. If you'd
    prefer a slimmer, more functional pack of extensions, <a
      href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chris-bell.experity-vscode-essentials">Experity VSCode
      Essentials</a> trims out the cosmetic ones.
    <!-- If you end up not liking some of the extensions included, feel free to uninstall them; -->

    <h3>Debugging</h3>
  </header>
  <p>
    If you're here for the first time, you probably did so by hitting F5. Well done! üëè Typing F5 launches the
    default debug configuration. Right now, that is "Launch dev build":
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/images/read-me/debug.PNG" alt="Debug launch configuration">
  </figure>
  <p>
    You can also hit the green play button instead of typing F5 to launch the debugger. VSCode's debugger is configured
    in the <code>launch.json</code> and <code>tasks.json</code> files. Don't worry about their contents for now, but
    it's good to keep in mind that they are what drives the debugger.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once running, the debugger behaves a lot like the Visual Studio debugger that you may be used to. Find
    <code>read-me.component.ts</code> and place a breakpoint in the <code>ngOnInit()</code> method:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/images/read-me/breakpoint.PNG" alt="Breakpoint in ngOnInit">
  </figure>
  <p>
    Manually refresh your browser and you should hit your breakpoint. On the left pane, you'll see the usual debugger
    information: variables in this scope, any watch conditions you may have set up, the current call stack, etc. You can
    resume execution by either hitting the resume button on the debugger menu, in Chrome itself, or by hitting F5.
  </p>
  <p>
    While debugging, you will have live reload of all of your Angular code. Try it out! Open
    <code>homecomponent.html</code>, change the text in the <code>h1</code> tag, and hit save. The running Angular
    server will recompile the code and refresh the Chrome tab so you can see your changes immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clicking on the dropdown at the top will show the other available debug configurations. The "Launch prod build"
    config will emulate how the app will be built in production: the build will be optimized and the app shell and
    service worker will be compiled.
  </p>
  <p>There is also a debug configuration for debugging unit tests. This configuration will launch an instance of the
    Karma test runner with live reload. After any change you make, Karma will run through all the unit tests and report
    the results. Not only will you be able to hit breakpoints in your <code>.ts</code> files, you'll <em>also</em> be
    able to hit breakpoints in any <code>spec.ts</code> files!</p>
